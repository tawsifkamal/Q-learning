In this project we will use a basic Reinforcement learning Q-learning algorithm to train an agent to play open AI Gym's FrozenLake game.
The steps to implement the algorithm are as follows:

1. Initialize the FrozenLake environment, define the global variables and hyperparameters, and create an empty Q-table.

2. Iterate thorough 10000 episodes and 100 time steps in order to train the RL agent by updating the Q-values in the Q-table through the Bellman's Optimality Equation.

3. Play the game by selecting the optimal actions from the updated Q-table and watch the agent win!
